I have extensive experience as a Production Support Analyst. I have supported many legacy based systems and now I am eager to update my skills as to work on modern micro services bases systems.My goal is learn Java 8, Spring Boot and MySQL which enable my backend development skills. My ultimate goal is to be a full stack developer by learning some front-end frameworks as well. 

I am currently working on learning source control using Git and Github. Also, I have started on Java with variables and flow control statements as of now.
